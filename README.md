## Overview
### Description
A college-specific social media platform for sharing student founded startups. This would allow students to learn about current active startups,
discuss potential ideas, get involved with other students, and even present their own unique ideas! Overall, it will foster an environment of
innovation and growth for all college campuses involved.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social Network / Entrepreneurship 
- **Mobile:** This app would be primary developed using Swift for iOS but then could be later ported to support Android as well. In theory, a web application
              could be designed for it as well, but since the focus is quick connectivity and collaboration, a mobile platform is ideal.
- **Story:** A news feed style app which shares posts on current student startups, open discussions on potential ideas, and allows students to find startups
             that they would be interested in getting involved in. The user would see all these posts on the Home Screen and would be allowed to interact with
             the community and find students with similar passions to work with.
- **Market:** Any student in college could use this app, and to allow for more organization and less cluster, students would be grouped together based on what
              college they go to. This means that students would only be able to see startups and discussions posts by other students on their campus.
